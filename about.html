    <span class="h1thing"><h1>Orgins of Stage Fright:</h1>
<p>Stage Fright was born out of a shared passion for music and teenage rebellion, when three high school friends named Kinzie, Carter, and Rory decided to channel their energy into creating something unforgettable. Raised in New Castle, the three would spend most nights huddled in Rory's garage, where restlessness evolved into raw, electrifying melodies.

    What started out as a jam session to break the tedium of small-town living grew into a band. The band members named themselves Stage Fright, which was about the nervousness they faced earlier when performing live-a thing they overcame together at their first small gig at a local coffeehouse. That vulnerability and genuineness found its place in audiences, and word started spreading about them.
    
    Classic rock, punk, and modern alternative influences blend into the sound of Stage Fright, which is both nostalgically familiar and refreshingly new. It reflects youthful determination brought them together in the first place. From high school talent shows to headlining local festivals, their journey stands as a testament to the power of friendship and pursuing dreams.</p>
